**Project:** Cyberpunk Terminal Hacking
**Team:** psykobilliethekid and ShariqT

**Overview:** 
Cyberpunk based game where the player has the role of a hacker trying to access different sections of a computer terminal.  

The terminal area will be shown on the left and will display the hacker’s progress. The right side of the screen will be divided in two: the top showing the WASD and arrow keys that will blink a sequence of letters and numbers and the bottom showing another set of WASD and arrow keys for the player to view when they try to repeat the sequence. 

The top area will blink a sequence of letters and numbers then stop after some time. There will be an area in the middle of the two sections that will say “INPUT REQUIRED” to alert the player to repeat the above sequence, “INPUT RECEIVED” when the correct sequence is repeated, and “SEQUENCE TERMINATED” when the incorrect sequence is input by the player. 

The left area will show DOS prompts showing how far they have gone in the terminal they are hacking. 

At the bottom will be buttons to restart the current level or exit the game.

Color scheme will be black and green. Core game will be set up in HTML with jQuery running the “simon” sequences and the game HUD so the game can be played in a browser.
